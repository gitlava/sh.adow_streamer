### DESCRIPTION ################################################################
# Script to add logging functionality into other scripts with possibilities to
# setup different levels and different output directions.
#
# This shell-script is developed as a "library" for other scripts, but not as a
# standalone application.

    echo log_level 1 -
    echo log_level 3 - debug.log
    echo log_level 2 - errors.log debug.log
    echo   From this moment redirection working until the end of your script
    echo   It works for every running application which can give output to
    echo   stdout or/and stderr or/and level3:
    echo   - stdout of every command will continue to be produced on screen
    echo   - level 3 is supposed to be debug level and will go to screen and
    echo     to the file debug.log
    echo   - stderr of every command will go to the stderr stream of your
    echo     script and to error.log, and to debug.log
